go mod init creates a new module, initializing the go.mod file that describes it.
go build, go test, and other package-building commands add new dependencies to go.mod as needed.
go list -m all prints the current moduleâ€™s dependencies.
go get changes the required version of a dependency (or adds a new dependency).
go mod tidy removes unused dependencies.
